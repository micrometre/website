Ensure people with impairments are able to navigate your site effectively. By providing options to change display options (colours, contrast levels, fonts, ability to zoom in up to 300% without the text spilling off the screen), navigate most of the website using just a keyboard, speech recognition software and listen to most of the website using a screen reader.
